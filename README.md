# OAuth and OpenID Connect

This repository contains the code used along with Keith Casey's LinkedIn Learning course called "Web Security: OAuth and OpenID Connect". Without that course, these examples will make less sense but may still be usable. You can check out the course here: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-security-oauth-and-openid-connect-23016424/describing-oauth-2-0

The course describes how to use OAuth and OpenID Connect and walks you through various use cases and examples. While many OAuth Authorization Servers - both open source and commercial - will let you complete the course, this repository includes two open source options with fully functional examples.

# How to Use this Code
