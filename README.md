# OAuth and OpenID Connect

This respository contains the code used along with Keith Casey's LinkedIn Learning course called "Web Security: OAuth and OpenID Connect". Without that course, these examples will make less sense but may still be usable.

The course describes how to use OAuth and OpenID Connect and walks you through various use cases and examples. While many OAuth Authorization Servers - both open source and commercial - will let you complete the course, this repository includes two open source options with fully functional examples.

# How to Use this Code

Basic install and configuration instructions are included in the README in each directory. Depending on which sample you are running, follow them completely.
